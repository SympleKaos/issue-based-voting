# Basic ideas 


## Rough Explanation

Design a system of election voting that separates the candidates from the issues
during the actual voting process.  Instead of voting for specific candidates during
the election period, each person would be given a series of questions on specific issues.
Rather than fighting biases and their contradictions, this system would embrace them.

Basically, the questionaire would seek to determine how a person feels about each
of the different issues.   A sliding scale would be presented rather than putting 
specific numeric values.  So one question might ask if the voter believes in 
Climate Change.  While another one might ask them if National Parks should be 
preserved.  The hope would be to balance out binary responses with questions that
try and elicit more nuanced reactions from the voters.  

After the results are tallied, the voter would be shown how each candidate running
for a particular office would aligns with their candidates.  They can then choose
up to three candidates.  First, second, and third choices.  Or none.  Choosing
no one gives the voter a way to escape the trap of "Pick the Lesser of Two Evils".
There is one additional twist.  If the voter's first choice is also the mostly aligned
candidate then that first choice gets weighted slightly higher.  So let's say
First choice is 3 points, Second is 2, and third is 1. The votes where most aligned
and First choice match would instead get 4 points.

Candidates are going to have it tougher.  They can only campaign on issues.  Everything
they do on the campaign trail must be to explain how they stand on issues.  In addtion,
the more they put into vetting their stances with verifiable and credible sources,
the more benefits they will have during the voting process.  Maybe something like
badges.  "Well Researched" "Faith Based" "Diverse Resources" "Consistent Values"

During their term, each policy decision will be compared to how much it differentiates
from how they campaigned.  But instead of just saying they flip-flopped.  The analysis
will include how well-reasoned and explained their policy decision.  This could earn
additional badges like "Open to Varying Viewpoints" "Reasses stance based on new information"
Voters could then use these analyses when they are considering a candidate seeking
re-election.  All of this information would be continously available.

Because the process would be so involved, there would not be an election day, but
rather a week.  Voters would have a week to complete the whole voiting process
before results were tallied.

So the goal of this project is to invite the opinions of those much smarter than me
and see if such a system could actually be designed and developed.
